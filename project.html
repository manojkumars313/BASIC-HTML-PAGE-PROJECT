    <h1>Backtracking</h1>
    <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion</p></br>

    <!--paragraph starts-->
    <p>The Usual scenario is that you are faced with anumber of options of options,and you must choose one of these. after
        you make your choice you will get a new set of options;just what set of options you get depends onwhat choice you
        get depends on what choice you made. This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final state. if 
        you made a good sequence of choices,your final state is agoal state;if you didn't,isn't.
    </p>
    <p>Conceptually,you start at the root of atree probably has some good leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be that
        the leaves are all good orall bad. You want to get to ag ood leaf. At each node,beginning with the root, you choose 
        one of its children to move to, and you keep this up until you get a leaf.
     </p>
     <p>suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search for agood leaf by revoking your mostrecent
        choice,and trying out the next option in that set of options, if you run out of options, revoke the choice that got
        you here, and try another choice at that node. if you end up at the root with no options left, there are no good leaves
        to be found.
      </p>

      <p>This needs an example</p>

                  <p class="round1" > this example we drew a picture of a tree.The tree is an abstract model of 
                    possible sequences of choices we could make.There is also a data structure called a tree.
                       but usually we don'have a data structure to tell us what choices we have.(if we
                       do have an actual tree data structure,backtracking on it is called depth-first
                       tree searching.)</p>

                              some goal node.we say that n is solvable. if solve(n) is solvable. if solve(n) is false ,then there si no path that includes n to any

                    <p>
                      Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive
                      algorithm can be rewritten as a stack algorithm, in fact that is how
                      your recursive algorithms are translated into machine or assembly
                      language
                    </p>

                        while the stack is not empty (
                    
                         if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf (
                    
                          if it is a goal node, return true
                    
                            else pop it off the stack
                        }

                         if the node at the top of the stack has untried children 
                            push the next untried child onto the stack 
                           else pop the node off the stack 
                    }

                      <p>
                        Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack
                        are the children of the node currently on the top of the stack, and
                        these are only pushed on one child at a time, hence, the nodes on the
                        stack at all times describe a valid path in the tree. Nodes are removed
                        from the stack only when it is known that they have no goal nodes among
                        their descendents. Therefore, if the root node gets removed (making the
                        stack empty) there must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution
                        to the problem.
                      </p>
                      <br />
                      <p>
                        When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack
                        form (in reverse order) a path from the root to a goal node
                      </p>
                      <br />
                      <p>
                        Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node, the path
                        information is embodied (in reverse order) in the sequence of recursive
                        calls. Thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node
                        at a time, by (for instance) printing the node at the current level, or
                        storing it in an array
                      </p>
                      <br />
                      <p>
                        Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm, modified slightly to print
                        (in reverse order) the nodes along the successful path
                      </p>

                          <p>
                            All of these versions of the hacktracking algorithms are pretty simple,
                            but when applied to a real prostem, they can get pretty tired up with
                            details Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex
                          </p>
                          <br />
                          <p>
                            for example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame
                            problem, the leaves are the checkmate and
                          </p>

                            To keep the gun cloan, therefore tests Tke this should be buried in
                            methods. In a chess game, for example, you could esc ed by writing a
                            <strong> gameOver method </strong>(or ou could even call it
                            <strong>isLeaf</strong>). This method would encapsulathe ugly details of
                            figuring out whether any possible moves remain

                            Notice that the back, acking anrithms require us to keep track, for each
                            node on the current path, which of its children have been med already so
                            we don't have to try them again) in the above code we made this look
                            simple, by just saying <strong>for each child c of c .</strong> may be
                            offficult to figure out what the possible children are, and there may be
                            no obvious way to step through trem in chess for example, a node can
                            represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each child of
                            that node can represent the arrangement ofter some piece has made a
                            legal move How do you find these children, and how do you keep track of
                            which ones you've already examined?
                          </p>
                          <br />
                          <p>
                            The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node
                            have been tried is as follows: Upon initial entry to the node (that is,
                            when you first get there from above), make a list of all its children.
                            As you try each child, take it off the list. When the 1st is empty,
                            there are no remaining untried children, and you can return "failure"
                            This is a simple approach, but it may require quite a lot of additional
                            work
                          </p>
                          <br />
                          <p>
                            There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried,
                            if you can define an ordering on the children. If there is an ordering,
                            and you know which child you just tried, you can determine which child
                            to try next
                          </p>
                          <br />
                          <p>
                            For example, you might be able to number the
                            <strong>children 1 through n,</strong> and try them in numerical order.
                            Then, if you have just tried <strong>child k</strong>, you know that you
                            have already triod children 1 through <strong> k-1</strong>, and you
                            have not yet tried children <strong>k+1</strong> through
                            <strong>n.</strong> Or if you are trying to color a map with just four
                            colors, you can a ways try
                            <strong>red first, then yellow, then green, then blue.</strong> if child
                            yellow fails you know to try child green next. If you are searching a
                            maze you can try choices in the order left straight, night
                            <strong>(or perhaps north, east, south, west). </strong>
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            It isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a
                            node <strong>In the chess game example,</strong> you might number your
                            -pieces for perhaps the squares of the board) and try them in numerical
                            order, but in addition each piece may also have never moves, and these
                            must also be ordered

                          <p>
                            For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking,
                            which is searching an actual tree. We will also use the simplest kind of
                            tree, a binary tree.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One node is
                            designated as the root node. Each node can reference point to) zero,
                            one, or two other nodes, which are called its children. The children are
                            referred to as the left child and/or the right child. All nodes are
                            reachable (by one or more steps) from the root node, and there are no
                            cycles For our purposes, although this is not part of the definition of
                            a binary tree, we will say that a node might or might not be a goal
                            node, and will contain its name. The first example in this paper (which
                            we repeat here) shows a binary tree

<p>Here's what the numbered lines are doing</p>
<br />
<ol>
  <ol type="1">
<li>
If we are given a null node, it's not solvable. This statement is so
that we can call this method with the chidren of a nooe, without first
checking whether those children actually exist

<li>If the node we are given is a goal node, return success</li>
<br />
<li>
See if the left child of node is solvable, and if so, conclude that
node is solvable We will only get to this line if node is non-null and
is not a goal node, says to

<br />
<li>Do the same thing for the right child.</li>
<br />
<li>
Since neither child of node is solvable, node itself is not solvable
</li>
<br />
</ul>
<p>
This program runs correctly and produces the unenlightening result true.
</p>
</ol>
<br />
<p>
Each time we ask for another node, we have to check if it is null in the
above we put that check as the first thing in solvable An alternative
would be to check first whether each child exists, and recur only if
they do. Here's that alterative version:
</p>
<br />

<pre class="round12">
  static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) {

    if (node.isGoalNode) return true;
    
    if (node.leftChild != null && solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;
    
    if (node.rightChild != null && solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;
    
    return false;

  }
</pre>
<br />

<p>
  I think the first version is simpler, but the second version is slightly
  more efficient.
</p>
<br />
<hr />
<br />
<h3>What are the children?</h3>
<br />
<p>
  One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that,
  at each choice point, you can ignore all the previous choices Previous
  choices don't give you any information about you should do next, as far
  as you know, both the left and the right child are possible solutions.
  In many problems, however, you may be able to eliminate children
  immediately, without recursion
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Consider, for example, the problem of four-cotoring a map It is a
  theorem of mathematics that any map on a plane, no matter how convoluted
  the countries are, can be colored with at most four colors, so that no
  two countries that share a border are the same color
</p>
<br />
<p>
  To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color
  for the second country, and so on, until all countnes are colored.
</p>
<br />
<p>There are two ways to do this :</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur When you run
    out of countries, check whether you are at a goal node
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an
    adjacent country, and recur if and when you run out of countries, you
    have successfully colored the map.
  </li>
  <br />
</ul>
<br />
<p>
  Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a
  checkerboard. This should be easily solvable, after all, a checkerboard
  only needs two colors.
</p>
<br />
<strong>boolean maplsOK()</strong>
<p>
  Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is
  colored correctly
</p>
<br />
<strong>boolean okToColor(int row, int column, int color)</strong>
<p>
  Used by method 2 to check, at every node, whether there is an adjacent
  node already colored with the given color
</p>
<br />
<strong>int nextRowAndColumn(int row, int column)</strong>
<p>
  Used by both methods to find the next "country" (actually the row and
  column of the next square on the checkerboard)
</p>
<br />
<br />
<p>Here's the code for method 1:</p>
<br />


<pre class="round13">
  boolean explore1(int row, int column, int color) {

    if (row>= NUM_ROWS)return mapisOK();
    
    map[row][column] = color,
    
    for (int nextColor= RED; nextColor < BLUE; nextColor++) {
    
        int[] next nextRowAndColumn(row, column);
        
        if (explore1(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true;

    }
    
    return false;
  }
</pre>
<br />

<p>And here's the code for method 2:</p>

<pre class="round14">

          boolean explore2 (int row, int column, int color) (

              if (row>= NUM_ROWS)return true;

              if (okToColor(row, column, color)) {

                  map[row][column] = color;

                  for (int nextColor= RED; nextColor < BLUE; nextColor++){

                      int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row, column);

                      if (explore2(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true;

                  }

              }

              return false;

          }
      </pre
>

<p>
  Those appear pretty similar, and you might think they are equally good.
  However, the timing information suggests otherwise
</p>
<br />

<table align="center">
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th style="background-color: #d8d8d8">2 by 3 map</th>
    <th style="background-color: #d8d8d8">3 by 3 map</th>
    <th style="background-color: #d8d8d8">3 by 4 map</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="background-color: #d8d8d8"><b>Method 1:</b></td>
    <td>60ms</td>
    <td>940ms</td>
    <td>60530 ms(1 min)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="background-color: #d8d8d8"><b>Method 2:</b></td>
    <td>0ms</td>
    <td>0ms</td>
    <td>0ms</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br />
<p>
  The zeros in the above table indicate times too short to measure (less
  than 1 millisecond). Why this huge difference? Either of these methods
  could have exponential growth. Eliminating a node automatically
  eliminates all of its descendents, and this will often prevent
  exponential growth. Conversely, by waiting to check until a leaf node is
  reached, exponential growth is practically guaranteed. If there is any
  way to eliminate children (reduce the set of choices), do so!

<h3>Debugging techniques</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it.
  Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes we need to fail back on inserting
  print statements There are some simple tricks to making effective use of
  print statements. These tricks can be applied to any program, but are
  especially useful when you are trying to debug recursive routines
</p>
<br />
<h3>Trick #1: Indent when you print method entries and exits.</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Often, the best debugging technique is to print every method call and
  return for at least the est important onen You probably want to print,
  for each method, what parameters it came in with, and what value it
  leaves with However, if you just print along list of these, it's hard to
  match up method exits with their corresponding entre indenting to show
  the level of nesting can help
</p>
<br />
<h3>Trick #2: Use specialized print methods for debugging.</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must. Also, remember
  that code inserted for debugging purposes can itself contain bugs, or
  (in the worst case) can affect the results, so be very careful with it.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Here's our debugging code For this trivial program, there's almost more
  debugging code than actual code, but in larger programs.
</p>

<pre class="round15">
      
                    static String indent ="",

                        else return node.name.

                        System.out.println(indent "Entering solvable("+name(node) - ")");

                        indent = indent + "|";
                    
                    }

                true

                </pre>
  
      <br />
      <b>Trick #3: Never discard your debugging statements.</b><br />
      <p>
        Writing debugging statements is programming, too. Often it's as much
        work to debug the debugging statements as it is to debug the actual
        program. Once your program is working, why throw this code away?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Obviously, you don't want to print out all this debugging information
        from a program you are ready to submit (or to turn over to your
        manager). You could comment out your debugging calls, but that can be a
        lot of work. What's more, in the above example, you would have to
        replace every return(yes(node)) with return(true), and every
        return(no(node)) with return false. With all these changes, you might
        introduce new bugs into your program.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The simple solution is to make your debugging statements conditional.
        For example,
      </p>
    

      <pre class="round16">
      
                static final boolean debugging = false; 
                
                
                static void enter(BinaryTree node) {
                    
                    if (debugging) {

                        System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node) + ")"); 

                        indent = indent + "| ";

                 }

             }


              static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) { 

                if (debugging) { 

                    indent = indent.substring(3); 

                    System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns true");

                 }

            }
            static boolean no(BinaryTree node) { 

                if (debugging) { 

                    indent = indent.substring(3); 

                    System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns false");
                
                }

            }
            </pre
      >
      <br />
      <p>
        In industry, actual programs often have multiple flags to control
        different aspects of debugging. Don't worry too much about making your
        code larger; modern compilers will notice that since the variable
        debugging is final, it can never be true, and the controlled code will
        be discarded.
      </p>
      <br />
      <b>Trick #4: Create an Exception.</b><br />
      <p>
        If an Exception is thrown, you can get information about just where it
        happened by sending it the message printStackTrace(PrintStream). Since
        an Exception is an object like any other, you can create and throw your
        own Exceptions. However, Java programmers don't always realize that you
        can create an Exception without throwing it. For example, the following
        code
      </p>
      <br />

      <pre class="round17">
                new Exception("Checkpoint Charlie").printStackTrace(System.out);
            </pre
      >

      <p>
        will print out a message something like this, and the program will then
        continue normally. That is, the above code just acts like a print
        statement.
      </p>

    <h3>Example: Cindy's Puzzle</h3>

    <p>
      I call the following puzzle "Cindy's puzzle" for historical reasons. You
      have some number n of black marbles and the same number of white
      marbles, and you have a playing board which consists simply of a line of
      2n+1 spaces to put the marbles in. Start with the black marbles all at
      one end (say, the left), the white marbles all at the other end, and a
      free space in between.
    </p>
    <table align="center" style="background-color: #d8d8d8 !important">
      <th><img src="black-ball.png"  /></th>
      <th><img src="black-ball.png" alt="" /></th>

      <th><img src="white-ball.png" alt="" /></th>
      <th><img src="white-ball.png" alt="" /></th>
    </table>
    <br />
    <p>The goal is to reverse the positions of the marbles:</p>
    <br />
    <table align="center" style="background-color: #d8d8d8 !important">

      <th><img src="black-ball.png" alt="" /></th>
    </table>
    <br />
    <b
      >The black marbles can only move to the right, and the white marbles can
      only move to the left (no backing up). At each move, a marble can
      either:</b
    >
    <ul>
      <li>Move one space ahead, if that space is clear, or</li>
      <li>
        Jump ahead over exactly one marble of the opposite color, if the space
        just beyond that marble is clear.

      The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In
      solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf, which in this
      case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This
      isn't so easy.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Now to the program. The main program will initialize the board, and call
      a recursive backtracking routine to attempt to solve the puzzle. The
      backtracking routine will either succeed and print out a winning path,
      or it will fail, and the main program will have to print out the bad
      news.
    </p>
    <br />

    <br />

      Each possible move will result in a new board position, and these new
      board positions are the children of the current board position. Hence to
      find the children of a node (that is, of a board position), we need only
      find the possible moves from that node. Remember that it is also highly
      desirable to find an ordering on these possible moves.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress, we must
      analyze the game to some extent. Probably a number of approaches would
      work, and what follows is based on the way I worked it out. If you were
      to program this puzzle, you might find a different but equally valid
      approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unique: if it
      can move ahead one square, then it cannot jump. If it can jump, it
      cannot move ahead one square. This suggests that, to find the possible
      moves, we might assign numbers to the marbles, and check each marble in
      turn. When we have looked at all the marbles, we have looked at all the
      possible moves. This would require having a table to keep track of where
      each marble is, or else somehow "marking" each marble with its number
      and searching the board each time to find the marble we want. Neither
      alternative is very attractive.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Next, notice that for a given board position, each marble occupies a
      unique space. Hence, instead of talking about moving a particular
      marble, we can talk about moving the marble in a particular space. If a
      move is possible from a given space, then that must be the only move
      possible from that space, because if the marble in that space has a
      move, it is unique. There is a slight complication because not every
      space contains a marble, but at least the spaces (unlike the marbles)
      stay in one place.
    </p>
    <br />
    <strong style="color: #424242"
      >Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program. Just
      check, in order, the 2n+1 spaces of the board. For each space, either
      zero or one moves is possible. With this understanding, we can write a
      boolean method canMove(int[] board, int position) which determines
      whether a move is possible from the given position:</strong
    ><br />
    <ul>
      <li>If the position is empty, no move is possible;</li>
      <li>
        If the position contains a black marble, the method checks for a move
        or jump to the right;
      </li>
      <li>
        If the position contains a white marble, the method checks for a move
        or jump to the left.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
      We write another method
      <strong>int[] makeMove(int[] oldBoard, int position)</strong> that will
      take a board and a position, make a move from that position, and return
      as its value a new board. (We could write this somewhat more efficiently
      by changing the old board, rather than creating a new one, but here we
      are more concerned with simplicity.) In technical jargon, makeMove is
      "applicative" rather than "mutative." <br />
      <br />
      Along with <strong>canMove and makeMove,</strong> we are using methods
      <strong>puzzleSolved and printBoard</strong> with meanings that should
      be obvious. With these methods, our central backtracking method can be
      written as follows:
    </p>
    <br />

    <pre class="round19"
    >
          boolean solvable(int[] board) { 

              if (puzzleSolved(board)) { 

                  return true; 

              }

               for (int position = 0; position < BOARD_SIZE; position++) {

                  if (canMove(board, position)) {

                   int[] newBoard = makeMove(board, position); 


                   if (solvable(newBoard)) { 

                      printBoard(newBoard); 

                      return true;
                      
                  }

               } 

              }
              
              return false;
           }
      </pre

    <br />

      Along with canMove and makeMove, we are using methods puzzleSolved and
      printBoard with meanings that should be obvious. <br />

      Notice that the solution is given in reverse order: BLACK starts out on
      the left and WHITE on the right, as in the last line. I've added line
      numbers to the actual output in order to emphasize this point.
      Backtracking always produces its results (sequence of choices) in
      reverse order; it is up to you, the programmer, to reverse the results
      again to get them in the correct order.
